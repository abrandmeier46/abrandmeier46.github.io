        <div class="z">Eagle River was the site of the first permanent Indian settlement in the Wisconsin Northwood’s, 
        located on the shores of Watersmeet Lake where the Wisconsin River and Chain 0′ Lakes meet.  
        
        These early Indians were called Old Copper Indians and were succeeded by the Woodland Indians from 
        2,600 B.C. to 800 A.D.  
        
        They were probably the ancestors of the Chippewa, Potawatomi and Menominee.</div>

        <div class="z">The city’s name was derived from the abundance of eagles nesting along the river.

        A settlement grew as numerous other families began living in the area in 1857.  
        
        John O’Connor and his son, George, are credited with being foremost among the founding fathers of Eagle River.  
        
        Their dedication to the growth of the community and their active participation in its civic and political affairs, 
        led to the creation of the town of Eagle River by an act of the State Legislature in 1885.</div>

        <div class="z">The population was primarily made up of lumberjacks who worked in the logging camps scattered throughout the area.  
        
        The only other residents of the town at that time were Finn Lawler, Charles L. Perry and Frank and Marilla Tambling.  
        
        Other inhabitants of the area included a few home- steaders, traveling trappers or fur buyers and the Indians, whose 
        encampments were mainly along the Wisconsin River.</div>

        <div class="z">Logging and fur trading were the dominant trades, and it wasn’t until 1925 with the development of the automobile that the resort industry began to grow.</div>

        <div class="z">Early records show as many as 1,500 to 1,600 people made up the population of Eagle River; now the current population of Eagle River is only 1,431.  
        
        The city itself is less than a couple of square miles, which explains the small growth in numbers.</div>
