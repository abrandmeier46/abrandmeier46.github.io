<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;">July 20, 2020</h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">We made a stop at all our favorite stores, including Gliks, the Popcorn shop, and the Country Store.  At Glik's I got a teal Salty Crew shirt and some light gray cotton shorts.  At the Popcorn shop, I got my favorite: the Chicago mix-an equal mix of caramel and cheese corn.  I then got $15 worth of candy from the Coutry Store.</p>

<h1 style="color:orchid;font-family:courier;text-align:center;">Trips Outside of Town</h1>
<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;">July 22, 2020</h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">I ended up meeting some friends to go to the St. Germain flea market, one of the must-go places near Eagle River.  We walked around for a bit and I ended up buying two gyros while my friends got burgers and chicken tenders.  We walked around for a bit more, and I ended up getting a $3 hat along with two pokemon card packs with my buddy.  We opened both at the same time to see who got the better cards, and my friend pulled a card worth $15!</p>
<h1 style="color:orchid;font-family:courier;text-align:center;">The Greatest Resort</h1>
<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;">July 17-24, 2020</h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">We stayed at Eagle Waters Resort which is located on the outskirts of the town of Eagle River.  It has everything you could want for a Northwoods resort, including a pool but also docks on Eagle Lake, Cabins for an authentic Northwoods experience, sports fields including a basketball court, volleyball court, and tennis court.  It also has its own restaraunt on the resort.  The Friday fish fry the restaraunt has to offer is to die for.</p>
<h1 style="color:orchid;font-family:courier;text-align:center;">A List of the Best Places to Go</h1>
<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;">July 17-24, 2020</h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">Lucy’s Lunchbox is quite possibly one of the best breakfast locations I’ve ever been to.  With great food, it also comes with cute decor.
The St. Germain flea market is always one of the highlights of the trip.  It is on a large, open plot of land and has stalls selling just about everything.
Elmer’s fun park is a great place to go go-karting.  With three different tracks, it’s always fun to switch which ones you go on.
Eagle Waters resort restaurant has a very good fish fry.  One of my personal favorites is the Kee-Mee-Kon Walleye.
Country Store has been the favorite gourmet candy store of my family for years.  With over 100 assorted candies and an ice-cream shop in the back, it’s a can’t miss.
Minocqua Popcorn Company is my favorite popcorn location because of their good deals.  A gallon bucket refill only costs $10!
Glik’s is probably the best clothing store I’ve ever been to.  With great styles and cool clothes, it’s always a go-to when I’m up there.
Lick-A-Dee Splitz is a great place to go get ice cream in Three Lakes with many different flavors and an intriguing ice-cream-eating challenge.
Eagle Falls minigolf is always a fun time.  They also have laser tag.
Although I have never been, I hear Kickback Grill has great food.</p>
