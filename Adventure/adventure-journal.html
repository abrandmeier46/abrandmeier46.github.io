<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">We made a stop at all our favorite stores, including Gliks, the Popcorn shop, and the Country Store.  At Glik's I got a teal Salty Crew shirt and some light gray cotton shorts.  At the Popcorn shop, I got my favorite: the Chicago mix-an equal mix of caramel and cheese corn.  I then got $15 worth of candy from the Coutry Store.</p>

<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;" id="July22"><em>July 22, 2020</em></h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">I ended up meeting some friends to go to the St. Germain flea market, one of the must-go places near Eagle River.  We walked around for a bit and I ended up buying two gyros while my friends got burgers and chicken tenders.  We walked around for a bit more, and I ended up getting a $3 hat along with two pokemon card packs with my buddy.  We opened both at the same time to see who got the better cards, and my friend pulled a card worth $15!</p>

<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;" id="July1724"><em>July 17-24, 2020</em></h2>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">We stayed at Eagle Waters Resort which is located on the outskirts of the town of Eagle River.  It has everything you could want for a Northwoods resort, including a pool but also docks on Eagle Lake, Cabins for an authentic Northwoods experience, sports fields including a basketball court, volleyball court, and tennis court.  It also has its own restaraunt on the resort.  The Friday fish fry the restaraunt has to offer is to die for.</p>

<h2 style="color:coral;font-family:arial;" id="July17242"><em>July 17-24, 2020</em></h2>
<ul style="font-family:timesnewroman;">
<li><strong>Lucy’s Lunchbox</strong> is quite possibly one of the best breakfast locations I’ve ever been to.  With great food, it also comes with cute decor.</li>
<li><strong>The St. Germain flea market</strong> is always one of the highlights of the trip.  It is on a large, open plot of land and has stalls selling just about everything.</li>
<li><strong>Elmer’s Fun Park</strong>  is a great place to go go-karting.  With three different tracks, it’s always fun to switch which ones you go on.</li>
<li><strong>Eagle Waters Resort &#38; Restaurant</strong>  has a very good fish fry.  One of my personal favorites is the Kee-Mee-Kon Walleye.</li>
<li><strong>Country Store</strong>  has been the favorite gourmet candy store of my family for years.  With over 100 assorted candies and an ice-cream shop in the back, it’s a can’t miss.</li>
<li><strong>Minocqua Popcorn Company</strong>  is my favorite popcorn location because of their good deals.  A gallon bucket refill only costs $10!</li>
<li><strong>Glik’s</strong>  is probably the best clothing store I’ve ever been to.  With great styles and cool clothes, it’s always a go-to when I’m up there.</li>
<li><strong>Lick-A-Dee Splitz</strong>  is a great place to go get ice cream in Three Lakes with many different flavors and an intriguing ice-cream-eating challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Eagle Falls minigolf</strong>  is always a fun time.  They also have laser tag.</li>
<li>Although I have never been, I hear <strong>Kickback Grill</strong>  has great food.</li>
