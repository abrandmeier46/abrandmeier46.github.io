<div id="a">Wake up to reality.  Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.  The longer you live, the more you will realize that the only 
things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering, and futility.  Listen, everywhere you look in this world, 
wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well.  As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will
also exist.  The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates wars, and hatred is born in order to protect love.  Man seeks peace, yet 
at the same time yearns for war.  Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that 
only humans could do. They’re two sides of the same coin to protect something, another must be sacrificed</div>
